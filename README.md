# Speech-Recognition
The Speech Recognition System using MATLAB is designed to recognize spoken words from “one” to “ten,” as well as commands like “stop” and “hi.” It captures voice input, extracts features using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and matches them with trained samples, enabling accurate and efficient voice-based human-computer interaction.
