# Speech-Recognition
The Speech Recognition System using MATLAB is designed to recognize spoken words from “one” to “ten,” as well as commands like “stop” and “hi.” It captures voice input, extracts features using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and matches them with trained samples, enabling accurate and efficient voice-based human-computer interaction.
The system is trained with multiple voice samples to ensure accurate recognition across different speakers. It preprocesses audio to reduce noise, normalizes signals, and segments words before feature extraction. Using MATLAB’s signal processing and machine learning tools, it demonstrates practical applications in voice-controlled interfaces.
